# Kanban Now Card Service

Basic service for handling Kanban cards.

This is my first foray into building a microservice.

The current implementation returns only the postponed cards for a specific board.

I will be adding more functionality soon and over time.


## Notes

This service was originally cloned from: https://github.com/liorhar/dropwizard-gradle
